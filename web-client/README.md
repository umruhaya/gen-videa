# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

**Note:** _strictly use pnpm as you package manager_

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```

install `pnpm` if you haven't:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
