# Astro Frontend

## Getting Started

1. Installing package manager for node

On Windows:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

or on MaCOS or Linux

```bash
sudo npm i -g pnpm
```

2. Install node modules by running `pnpm i` when you are getting started or whenever you pull changes using `git pull`

3. Start the development server using `pnpm run dev`

4. In another teminal, run the CORS proxy to avoid getting errors with api calls

```bash
cd web-client
pnpm proxy
```

5. Use git lens vscode extension to add and commit files or you can also do it manually using git in yoru terminal

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HeroHeader.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Signin.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Signup.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ signin.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ signup.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ dashboard.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
